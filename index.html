Rama Rao first appeared as a child artiste in the film Brahmarshi Viswamitra, written, directed and starred by his grandfather N. T. Rama Rao in 1991. He went on to play the titular role as Rama in the 1997 mythological film Ramayanam. Rama Rao made his debut as a lead actor in 2001 with the film Ninnu Choodalani, which was a box office failure. He tasted his first success in the same year with the S. S. Rajamouli's directorial debut, coming-of-age action film Student No.1.</p>
	<p> Though Subbu which released in the same year could not impress the audience, his 2002 action film Aadi was a massive success. For the film, Rama Rao received Nandi Special Jury Award presented by the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The two next films Allari Ramudu and Naaga were back-to-back failures. His second collaboration with the director S. S. Rajamouli was the 2003 action film Simhadri, which ended up as one of the biggest blockbusters of that year. In the film, Rama Rao is seen as a kind-hearted man, Simhadri who has a violent past. In 2005, Rama Rao played a dual role for the first time film Andhrawala directed by Puri Jagannadh. The film could not reach the high expectations and bombed at the box office. Samba which released in the same year had a decent response but his subsequent films Naa Alludu, Narasimhudu and Ashok were a string of failures.</p>
	<p> In 2006, Rama Rao starred in the film Rakhi, which is considered one of his finest performances.[citation needed][by whom?] Though the film was an average grosser, his performance in the role of innocent man-turned vigilante and climax sequence were praised particularly.

Over the next few years, Rama Rao starred in several films, notably Oosaravelli and Baadshah. His consequent films, Ramayya Vasthavayya and Rabhasa were box office failures which received lukewarm response both audience and his fans alike, for which Rama Rao was deeply disappointed and promised his fans to work harder. In 2015, Rama Rao made his second collaboration with the director Puri Jagannadh in the action film Temper which gave the actor a much needed comeback. In the film, he played a corrupt police officer, whose life changes after stumbling upon a rape case. In his landmark 25th film, Rama Rao featured in the 2016 thriller - drama, Nannaku Prematho written and directed by Sukumar.
